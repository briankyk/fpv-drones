First-Person-View (FPV) Drones
==============================

This repository serves to store my fpv drones settings and my drone related technical notes.

The term "**fpv drones**" in this repository refers to the type of remote controlled multirotor model aircrafts that are equipped with camera which live stream camera feed to a set of goggles worn by the pilot, creating an immersive experience as if the pilot is located in the cockpit.

Knowledge in this repository has been obtained through the courtesy of the amazing fpv drone community who have been producing tremendous contents to allow me to participate in this facinating hobby.

> **Attention**  
> Drone flying is a serious hobby and safety is of paramount importance when operating any UAVs, any negligence could result in damage to properties, serious injuries or even death. Please respect good airmanship and follow local regulations of the country in which you operate your UAVs.

## Side Notes
It is gut-wrenching to see fpv drones being used in bombing missions during the currently on-going Russian invasion of Ukraine, and I hope this tragedy will end in Ukrainian victory as soon as possible so we can fully enjoy our beloved hobby in peace once again.
