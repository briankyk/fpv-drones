# Getting Started

FPV drones are incredibly fun to fly, however unlike typical consumer drones like those produced by DJI and Parrot, the learning curve is quite steep and it takes substantial effort to not only learn how to fly, but also how to maintain your equipment. Having some background knowledge in physics, mechanical engineering and electronics will certainly help make the learing process a lot easier.
  
In addition, **safety** is the most important aspect of this hobby, therefore please also spend time to study the local UAV regulations and safety guidelines of the country in which you will operate your drones in. Since I operate in Canada mainly, [here](https://tc.canada.ca/en/aviation/drone-safety) are the regulations that I need to follow.  

## Steps I Took to Get Into FPV

1. Study different aspect of FPV drone flying including [types of FPV drones](./MULTIROTOR.md), [equipment required](./PILOT_EQPT.md), [drone hardare components](./DRONE_HARDWARE.md), [FPV drone related software](./SOFTWARE.md), [tools and materials required](./TOOLS_MATL.md) and [how to fly in general](./TECHNIQUES.md).
2. Study [local regulations](https://tc.canada.ca/en/aviation/drone-safety) with regards to UAV operations. 
3. Joining different FPV communities to know other pilots.
4. Purchase a [radio controller](./PILOT_EQPT.md#radio-controller-and-radio-transmitter) and practice [basic maneuvers](./TECHNIQUES.md) on [simulator](./SOFTWARE.md#simulator). 
5. Accumulate around 20 hours of stick time, then purchase [my gear](./SETUP_CONFIG.md) and [tools](./TOOLS_MATL.md).
6. Pass my drone pilot exam, and get all the legal stuffs done.
7. Practice soldering.
8. Go flying with friends.
9. Crashed my drone and fixed it.
10. Keep flying.
11. Learning [new tricks](./TECHNIQUES.md#air-tricks).
12. Build my next drone (soon).
13. Keep flying and enjoy the experience.
