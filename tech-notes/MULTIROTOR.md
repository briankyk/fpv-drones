# Multirotor Model Aircraft

Multirotor model aircraft, also known as multirotor drones, are rotocrafts with more than two lift-generating rotors.

General types of multirotors include:

- Bicopter
- Tricopter
- Quadcopter (most common fpv drone configuration)
- Pentacopter
- Hexacopter
- Octocopter

The naming is denoted by the number of rotors onboard the drone. One special type of motor arrangement is the [coaxial-rotor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaxial-rotor_aircraft) arrangement, which the rotors are mounted one above the other on concentric shafts, with the same axis of rotation, but turning in opposite directions.

In this repository, I will mainly focus on QuadCopter (4-motor multicopter) since it is the only type of model aircraft that I fly. 

Here is a good introductory [article](https://oscarliang.com/types-of-multicopter/) by Oscar Liang.
